## Project Overview
This project will give your team an opportunity to describe an innovative idea for a web application that your team will be developing over the course of the semester. In addition, your team will develop a mock user interface (UI) using HTML and CSS that will show us what your application will look like and some of the data that will be displayed. Naturally, we expect your thoughts and ideas of your project to change during the course of the semester leading to changes in the data your application will support and the interface your users will expect. This and all future projects will be building blocks leading to the final project submission at the end of the semester.
