## Innovative Idea
The purpose of our web app is to provide a space for students to interact with other members of classes that they are enrolled in through short tweet-like posts and direct messages. Users will be able to subscribe to news feeds from classes that they are currently taking or classes that they are interested in taking. Class feeds will be a place for users to make general discussion posts about the class or pose questions to classmates. 

In addition, users will be able to see which of their classmates have been enrolled in the same classes as them and message each other directly for specific questions or comments. 
Our app will derive features such news feeds and direct messaging which exist in social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. One unique feature that we plan to incorporate will be the ability to distinguish feeds by class. Another unique feature will be that users have the ability to see which classes they have taken have overlapped with other users, and reach out to them to discuss previous classes and future plans. Finally, our app will allow users to associate specific teachers with specific classes, allowing for students to comment on which classes should be taken with which teachers.

## Important Data
Our app will incorporate five major data types in its functionality. The primary data type is the Student. A student is a user with a name (or nickname), and a list of classes that they are currently enrolled in and have previously taken. Users will be able to log in to the app to view and edit their profile, and students will be able to see the profiles of other students in their classes. Another data type is a class. A class has a list of posts associated with it, a list of students enrolled and a teacher. A teacher has a name and an overall rating, similar to the rating system on review sites like RateMyProfessor. 

The final two data types are post and message. A post has an author, a counter of positive votes, and a set of replies from other authors. Students can create posts in a class feed and publish them for other students to see. Messages have an author and a recipient. Students can send messages to each other via the direct messaging service in the app.

## User Interface

The user interface for our app will consist of five major user experience components and five views. The UX components will consist of:
- Search boxes - for finding classes and specific students to message
- Buttons - for navigation throughout the interface
- Text boxes - for writing posts and messages and submitting them
- Lists - for displaying news feeds and messages between students
- Messages - for communication between students

The app itself will have five views for users to navigate through. The home view will be landing page for the app, and it will contain a list of classes that the user is enrolled in, a list of students that the user can directly message, and a news feed for one of the classes. If the user wants to see a different news feed, he can click on a different class name on the side panel. From the home view, users can go to their own profile view or the profile of another student where they can see what classes that student is currently enrolled in and has taken prior to the current semester. If the user clicks on a class name, they can go to the view of that class where they will see the class roster and which teachers are associated with that class. A final view will be for users to directly message each other.
